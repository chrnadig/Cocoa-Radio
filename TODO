General:
- replace property access in loops by local variables
- replace (id) with (instancetype) in -initâ€¦ methods
- replace .y and x. float with x.y floats
- replace alloc/init with new
- revisit NSConditions/NSLocks - eliminate when not needed
- remove all @synthesize occurrences
- merge multiple @class lines into one
- unify parameter names to see a flow of data through methods (look for data, complexRaw, complexInput etc.)
- move all private properties to .m file

CSDRRingBuffer:
- replace ring buffer design eventually with an array of incoming CSDR*Arrays, to save one copy operation

CSDRFFT:
- replace log2 calculation with loop instead of log2() function call
- the two ring buffers (real and imag) could possibly overflow independantly, causing real and imag data to desync (although not possible in current implementation, might become a problem in the future)

CSDRfilter:
- Rename (uppercase F)
- Split into multiple files (there are subclasses defined and implemented in same files)

CSDRlowPassFloat:
- rename to CSDRLowPassReal (capital L and Real instead of float)

CSDRlowPassComplex:
- rename to CSDRLowPassComplex (capital L)

CSDRDemod (and subclasses):
- return bandwith/frequency etc. ranges in struct instead of min/max readonly methods
- move common demodulation code to base class!

CSDRAudioDevice:
- split into two files (there are two classes)

CSDRAppDelegate:
- move all radio related code to CSDRRadio class and only leave GUI related stuff in CSDRAppDelegate
