General:
- replace property access in loops by local variables
- replace (id) with (instancetype) in -initâ€¦ methods
- replace .y and x. float with x.y floats
- replace alloc/init with new
- revisit NSConditions/NSLocks - eliminate when not needed
- remove all @synthesize occurrences


CSDRRingBuffer:
- replace NSMutableData with float *malloc()
- maybe simpler implementation?

CSDRFFT:
- replace log2 calculation with loop instead of log2() function call
- the two ring buffers (real and imag) could possibly overflow independantly, causing real and imag data to desync (although not possible in current implementation, might become a problem in the future)

CSDRfilter:
- Rename (uppercase F)
- Split into multiple files (there are subclasses defined and implemented in same files)
